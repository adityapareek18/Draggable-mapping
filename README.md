# DraggableMatTreeMapping witj Leader Lines

## Working demo

https://angular-khfrwr.stackblitz.io

Some issue is there with the stackblitz demo, like a child connected child node will show dotted line if its parent is collapsed. And the lines should move with scroll
which is also not working in stackblitz. I recommend to the download the ZIP and serve using Angular CLI to see it in full action.

## Installation

Run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
